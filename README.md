Heart Attack Prediction Using Different ML Models
This repository contains code for predicting the likelihood of a heart attack using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains several features related to heart health, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.

Instructions
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
git clone [https://github.com/anushka-2208/heart-attack-prediction](https://github.com/anushka-2208/Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Different-ML-Models).git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd heart-attack-prediction

Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook Heart_Attack_Prediction.ipynb to see the code and results.
# Dataset

The dataset used in this project (heart.csv) contains the following attributes:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise-induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect
target: 0 = less chance of heart attack, 1 = more chance of heart attack
